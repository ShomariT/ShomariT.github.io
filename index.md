## About Me

I am currently a senior at the University of Alabama majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics with an expected graduation date of May 2022.  I am doing research with the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) robotics disciplinary using devices such as the electroencephalogram.

## About My Mentor

Chris Crawford assistant professor at The University of Alabama works at the intersection of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Robotics. Investigating systems that leverage physiological signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) to enhance Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). He is also researching ways to lower the barriers to entry for novice programmers interested in designing and developing BCI applications.

## About My Project

A collaboration with The University of Alabama to create the ability to use prototyping with tools like the electroencephalography (EEG) for educational purposes using external software and hardware like the Arduino. Will use prototyping to give an interactive ability and to teach middle and high school students about computer science and how to create prototypes themselves.

Week 1 : 
The first week of my REU experience was spent talking to Dr. Crawford, brainstorming about ideas on the research project. We talked about the absence of journal with infomation about using prototyping for educational purposes. Brainstormed on how we could potientally use low fidelity so students could have the ability to create mock up prototypes while learning about robotics and computer science. 

Week 2:
The second week of the REU was spent on thinking about potiential mockups of prototypes that we could build for participants could use. I was assigned to create the mockups on paper so that we could review them later in the week. I created roughly 20 ideas of interactive mockups that would possibly grab the attention of the future participant. We narrowed down some of the drawings so we could have a better scope of how we could continue. 

Week 3:
In week 3 Dr. Crawford and I came up with a specific scope to take with design of the prototypes, Dr. Crawford and I discussed the potiental ability to use open source hardware and software with the prototypes. Arduino was the open source tool that we decided to work with. I began to do research on arduino and I was granted access to tutorials to learn how to program and create circuits with the Arduino. 

Week 4: 
In week 4 I was still trying to grab a concept of using the Arduino software. The arduino uses a programming langauge similar to C but with some variables that confused me. This was confusing because I am used to programming in languages like C and C++ but the external variables and syntax that Arduino uses made things more difficult. Also, the Arduino has hardware component which was completely new to me. I had little to no experience in creating circuits to hook up to the arduino. After plenty days of training I was finally able to create a complex circuit with the Arduino. 

Week 5: 
In week 5 of the REU. Dr. Crawford gave me the task to create a complicated circuit with a servo motor and other components like buttons. I began tackling the hardware components to create the circuit. I created the circuit but I stumbled across a problem with powering up the servo motor. This was very frustrating because I felt like I had done everything right. I tested the motor by creating a simple circuit and it worked perfectly fine but when I used it with the complicated circuit, it got little to no power. I did my research on a problem and glanced across multiple potiential solutions and none of them worked. I used a voltmeter to test for shortages or open circuits and never found a problem. After trying countless methods I decided to use another arduino with the servo motor and it worked perfectly. It turns out that the old arduino stopped applying the right amount of current due the overwork on the Arduino uno.
