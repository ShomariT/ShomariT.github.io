## About Me

I am currently a senior at the University of Alabama majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics with an expected graduation date of May 2022.  I am doing research with the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) robotics disciplinary using devices such as the electroencephalogram.

## About My Mentor

Chris Crawford assistant professor at The University of Alabama works at the intersection of Brain-Computer Interface (BCI), Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), and Robotics. Investigating systems that leverage physiological signals such as electroencephalography (EEG) to enhance Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). He is also researching ways to lower the barriers to entry for novice programmers interested in designing and developing BCI applications.

## About My Project

A collaboration with The University of Alabama to create the ability to use prototyping with tools like the electroencephalography (EEG) for educational purposes using external software and hardware like the Arduino. Will use prototyping to give an interactive ability and to teach middle and high school students about computer science and how to create prototypes themselves.

## My Blog

Week 1 : 
The first week of my REU experience was spent talking to Dr. Crawford, brainstorming about ideas on the research project. We talked about the absence of journal with infomation about using prototyping for educational purposes. Brainstormed on how we could potientally use low fidelity so students could have the ability to create mock up prototypes while learning about robotics and computer science.
